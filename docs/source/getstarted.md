# Getting Started

Validations Engine depends on **Python 3.7.6+**.

[Python Package Index](https://pypi.org/project/validations-engine/) hosts reference to a pip-installable 
module of this library, using it is as straightforward as including it on your project's requirements.

```bash
pip install validations-engine
```

Or after listing `validations-engine` in your `requirements.txt` file:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Adding a new validation suite
Check [here](new_validation_suite.md) the instructions to create a new validation suite.
